This commit:
------------
- set_weights to include setting them arbitrarily, and using andrew ng's suggestion for initial weights

Next commit:
------------
- Separate out the bias term (this will take some time/debugging...)

Backlog:
-------
- start working on other parts of the deep learning tutorial
- get momentum, improved momentum, SGD, and other optimization techniques working again
- add mini-batch_fit to NeuralNetworkCore (part of getting SGD to work)
- start training a deep network using greedy layer-wise training
- autodiff + theano
- look into packing/deprecation
- Apply a sparse autoencoder to london scikits data
